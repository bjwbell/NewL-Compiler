This directory contains the scanner Scanner.x for the NewL language. To compile the scanner type "make". For error reporting the scanner prints a simple 
message which includes the line and column number of the error.

The scanner is processed by Alex and compiled by ghc, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
