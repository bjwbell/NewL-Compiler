The parser directory contains the scanner and parser for NewL. I used Alex as the scanner generator and Happy as the parser generator. Both the scanner and parser are written in Haskell. 

The scanner directory contains a standalone scanner for NewL.

The test_files directory contains test files for the scanner, parser and type checker for NewL.
