The Alex scanner file is Scanner.x and the Happy grammar file is Newl.y. To compile the program run
make
The output is "newl" which is a very basic parser for the NewL language. To test the parser do
cat ./test_files/parser_success_test1.newl | ./newl in the directory with newl. It will output the parse tree representation of the parser_success_test1.newl program.

To remove all compiled files run make clean.

To test error reporting run
1. cat ./test_files/lexer_error_test1.txt | ./newl
It will report "newl: lexical error @ line xx and column yy" where xx and yy are the line and column numbers of the error.
2. cat ..test_files/parser_error_test1.newl | ./newl
It will report "newl: parse error at line 3 and columne 9". The parse error is due 
to the main function not having a statement. Please note "1<2;" is an expression not a statement.
