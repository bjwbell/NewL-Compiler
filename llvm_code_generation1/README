The Alex scanner file is Scanner.x and the Happy grammar file is Newl.y. To compile the program run
make
The output is "newl" is a basic type checker for the NewL language. To test the type checker do
cat ./test_files/type_success_test1.newl | ./newl in the directory with newl. It will report that the semantic analysis was successful.

To remove all compiled files run make clean.

To test error reporting run
1. cat ./test_files/lexer_error_test1.txt | ./newl
It will report "newl: lexical error @ line xx and column yy" where xx and yy are the line and column numbers of the error.
2. cat ..test_files/type_error_noclass.newl | ./newl
It will report that there's a missing class definition.
